# Proximity_senzor
This project include infrared proximity senzor which if triggered change the intense of ilumunation of diode. 
Also there is a button which change colors of diode. Senzor have non triggered set logic zero, if triggered, send logic one to raspberry pi and that trigger change of color. Wiring is closly described at scheme.

## Working exmaple:
User will push button for desired color. After that user will trigger senzor for desired brightness of choosen color and can choose
another color and repeat proces. 

## Hardware reguirments
- Raspberry pi 3
- infrared proximity senzor
- three resistors (located behind diode)
- two state button
